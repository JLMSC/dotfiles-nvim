# dotfiles-nvim
This repository contains all my configurations for [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io).<br>

This is meant to be a minimal Neovim setup, primarily focused on being a text editor with fancy highlighting.<br>
It does not, and will not, include any code-related features beyond [**LSP**](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and [**DAP**](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap).<br>
However, feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
